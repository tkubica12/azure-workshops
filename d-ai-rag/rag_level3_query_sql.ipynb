       "1. **\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\"**:\n",
       "   - Set during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Prague serves as a vital backdrop for the emotional and political turmoil faced by the characters. While the city is portrayed as beautiful and culturally rich, the atmosphere is overshadowed by the oppressive invasion. Though the mysterious and ancient qualities of Prague are hinted at through its rich history and architecture, the film primarily focuses on the characters' relationships and existential struggles.\n",

       "2. **\"Anthropoid\"**:\n",
       "   - This movie also takes place in Prague, specifically during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Prague becomes a key location for the assassination plot against Nazi officer Reinhard Heydrich. The city's historical significance is central to the film, but the focus is more on the resistance efforts and the grim realities of war rather than its mysterious or ancient aspects.\n",

       "Movies about drugs often explore both serious and comedic tones, depending on the narrative focus and thematic goals. Here's a breakdown of the two approaches:\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Serious Tone**\n",
       "Many films adopt a serious tone to delve into the darker aspects of drug use, trafficking, and addiction. These movies typically aim to provoke thought, highlight social issues, or portray the devastating consequences of drug involvement. Examples include:\n",
       "- **\"Traffic\"**: Explores the complexities and societal impact of the war on drugs through multiple perspectives.\n",
       "- **\"Requiem for a Dream\"**: Offers a harrowing look at addiction and its destructive effects on individuals and relationships.\n",
       "- **\"Trainspotting\"**: Depicts the chaos of heroin addiction and its impact on friendships and personal growth.\n",
       "- **\"The Basketball Diaries\"**: Chronicles the descent into drug addiction and its life-altering consequences.\n",
       "These films often evoke emotions like sadness, empathy, and reflection, emphasizing the gravity of drug-related struggles.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Comedic Tone**\n",
       "On the other hand, some films use humor to address drug culture and its absurdities, often focusing on stoner lifestyles, misadventures, and lighthearted escapades. These movies aim to entertain rather than educate, showcasing the carefree attitudes and mishaps of characters involved with drugs. Examples include:\n",
       "- **\"Up in Smoke\"**: Follows two stoners on a series of humorous misadventures.\n",
       "- **\"Half Baked\"**: Centers on friends trying to bail out a friend while navigating hilarious situations.\n",
       "- **\"How High\"**: Combines comedy with fantastical elements as two stoners use marijuana to succeed in college.\n",
       "- **\"Pineapple Express\"**: Blends action and comedy as a stoner and his dealer are forced to run from criminals.\n",
       "These films often evoke laughter, fun, and a sense of camaraderie among their characters.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Balance of Both**\n",
       "Some movies incorporate both serious and comedic elements to provide a nuanced portrayal of drug-related themes:\n",
       "- **\"The Beach Bum\"**: Features a lovable rogue navigating life with a humorous yet chaotic approach to drug use.\n",
       "- **\"We're the Millers\"**: Uses comedy to explore drug trafficking through a fake family setup.\n",
       "- **\"The 51st State\"**: Combines humor and action in the world of drug deals gone wrong.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Conclusion**\n",
       "The tone of drug-related movies largely depends on the filmmaker’s intent. Serious films often aim to critique societal issues or portray the consequences of drug involvement, while comedic ones focus on entertainment and absurdity. Both approaches can resonate with audiences, offering either emotional depth or lighthearted escapism."
