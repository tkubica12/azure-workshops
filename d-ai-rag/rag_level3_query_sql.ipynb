       "### Serious Depictions:\n",
       "Films that explore the **serious side** of drugs often delve into the moral, societal, and psychological ramifications of drug addiction, trafficking, and the impact on individuals and communities. These movies tend to focus on crime, addiction, struggles, and redemption, offering intense and dramatic portrayals. Examples include:\n",
       "- **Traffic**: Examines the war on drugs from multiple perspectives, including law enforcement, families, and cartels, highlighting the devastating consequences of drug use and trafficking.\n",
       "- **Blow**: Chronicles the rise and fall of a drug kingpin, focusing on the allure and dangers of wealth and power in the drug trade.\n",
       "- **Requiem for a Dream**: Offers a haunting look at addiction, showing the tragic consequences of substance abuse on the lives of the characters.\n",
       "- **Trainspotting**: Though it contains moments of dark humor, its depiction of heroin addiction is deeply poignant and tragic.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Funny Depictions:\n",
       "On the other hand, movies about drugs can also be positioned within the **comedic realm**, using the subject for humor, absurdity, or satire. These films often feature stoner comedy, parody, or exaggerated scenarios surrounding drug use or trafficking. Examples include:\n",
       "- **Up in Smoke**: A classic stoner comedy that follows two pot-smoking slackers on their misadventures.\n",
       "- **Half Baked**: A light-hearted comedy about friends trying to bail their friend out of jail, filled with humorous depictions of drug culture.\n",
       "- **How High**: Combines stoner humor with a fantastical premise, where two characters use \"magical\" weed to ace their exams and attend Harvard.\n",
       "- **We're the Millers**: A comedy about a pot dealer who creates a fake family to smuggle drugs across the border, blending humor with crime.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mixed Approaches:\n",
       "Some films blend humor with serious undertones, offering a mix of lightheartedness and reflection:\n",
       "- **The 51st State**: Uses humor and action to showcase the complexities of drug deals gone wrong.\n",
       "- **Keanu**: Features comedic characters posing as drug dealers in a crime-driven plot, combining humor with action.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "The portrayal of drugs in cinema can be **serious** when focusing on addiction, crime, and societal consequences, or **funny** when leaning into stoner comedies, absurd scenarios, or satirical takes on drug culture. The choice depends on the narrative and genre, allowing filmmakers to either provoke thought or provide entertainment."
