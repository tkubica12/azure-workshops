       "If you're looking for movies similar to *Star Wars*, here are some recommendations that align with the sci-fi adventure, space exploration, and hero-driven narratives you might enjoy:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Rogue One: A Star Wars Story**  \n",
       "   If you haven't seen this standalone *Star Wars* film yet, it's a perfect choice. It follows a rogue band of resistance fighters on a mission to steal the Death Star plans, offering a grittier and more grounded take on the *Star Wars* universe.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Interstellar**  \n",
       "   This movie delves into space exploration and has a strong emotional core, akin to the human connections explored in the *Star Wars* saga. It’s about a group of explorers searching for a new home for humanity while traversing mind-bending scientific challenges.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Guardians of the Galaxy**  \n",
       "   This Marvel film combines humor, action, and a ragtag team of heroes in a spacefaring adventure. The dynamic between the characters and the vibrant world-building is reminiscent of the lighter, adventurous tone of *Star Wars*.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Starship Troopers**  \n",
       "   A thrilling sci-fi film with military undertones, focusing on humanity's war against an alien species. It has action-packed battles and a commentary on society, making it a darker but engaging choice.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Treasure Planet**  \n",
       "   This animated film offers a unique blend of adventure and space exploration. It’s inspired by *Treasure Island* but set in space, with a young protagonist embarking on a journey to find intergalactic treasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **The Fifth Element**  \n",
       "   A sci-fi classic with quirky characters, colorful visuals, and an epic battle to save humanity from destruction. Its mix of humor, action, and futuristic settings might remind you of the *Star Wars* vibe.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Avatar**  \n",
       "   Directed by James Cameron, this film takes you to the moon Pandora and explores themes of resistance, environmentalism, and human-alien interaction—similar to how *Star Wars* tackles interplanetary conflicts and cultural clashes.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Spaceballs**  \n",
       "   If you’re in the mood for something lighthearted, this parody of *Star Wars* is hilarious and pokes fun at many sci-fi tropes. It’s a fun way to revisit the genre with a comedic twist.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Star Trek (2009)**  \n",
       "   The reboot of the *Star Trek* franchise offers a fresh, action-packed take on space exploration. The dynamic between Kirk and Spock provides compelling character drama, much like Luke and Han in *Star Wars*.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Dune**  \n",
       "    Whether you choose the 1984 original or the newer adaptation, *Dune* offers a sprawling sci-fi world with political intrigue, epic battles, and mystical elements that echo themes from *Star Wars*.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **Serenity**  \n",
       "    A continuation of the *Firefly* TV series, this film follows a crew of renegades navigating interplanetary conflicts and a mysterious government conspiracy. The blend of humor, action, and camaraderie will feel familiar to *Star Wars* fans.\n",
       "\n",
       "These films share similar elements of epic storytelling, space battles, and dynamic characters, providing plenty of options to explore after diving deep into the *Star Wars* universe!"

Tereza is surprised to learn that Tomas is already having an affair with the bohemian Sabina. When the Soviet invasion occurs, all three flee to Switzerland. Sabina begins an affair, Tomas continues womanizing, and Tereza, disgusted, returns to Czechoslovakia. Realizing his mistake, Tomas decides to chase after her.\n",

       "Movies about drugs can span a wide range of tones and genres, meaning they can be either serious or funny depending on the story being told and the filmmaker's intent. Here's how these tones manifest in drug-related films:\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Serious Films**\n",
       "These movies often explore the darker, more dramatic elements of drug culture, addiction, and crime. They focus on the societal impact, personal struggles, and moral dilemmas that arise from involvement with drugs. Examples include:\n",
       "- **\"Traffic\"**: A multi-perspective exploration of the war on drugs, tackling personal, political, and societal consequences.\n",
       "- **\"Requiem for a Dream\"**: A harrowing look at addiction and how it devastates the lives of its characters.\n",
       "- **\"American Gangster\"**: A serious crime drama about the rise and fall of a heroin kingpin in Harlem.\n",
       "- **\"Trainspotting\"**: A gritty portrayal of heroin addiction and its impact on a group of friends in Edinburgh.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Funny Films**\n",
       "On the lighter side, many drug-related films use humor to depict absurd or exaggerated situations involving drugs. These films often focus on misadventures or comedic outcomes rather than the grim realities of drug use. Examples include:\n",
       "- **\"Up in Smoke\"**: A classic stoner comedy about two potheads embarking on a series of misadventures.\n",
       "- **\"Half Baked\"**: A lighthearted story about three friends trying to bail their buddy out of jail.\n",
       "- **\"Pineapple Express\"**: A stoner action-comedy involving a marijuana user and his dealer who get caught up in a murder case.\n",
       "- **\"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\"**: A comedic journey of two stoners on a mission to satisfy their munchies.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Mixed Tone**\n",
       "Some films combine humor and seriousness to explore the complexities of drug culture in a balanced way:\n",
       "- **\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\"**: Both absurdly funny and deeply unsettling, this movie captures the surreal effects of extreme drug use.\n",
       "- **\"The Gentlemen\"**: A crime comedy about a marijuana empire, blending dark humor with intense moments.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "Whether serious or funny, movies about drugs often reflect the multifaceted nature of drug culture. Serious films tend to focus on the impact of drugs on individuals and society, while funny films lean into the absurdity and misadventures associated with drug use. The tone ultimately depends on the filmmaker's approach and the story being told."
