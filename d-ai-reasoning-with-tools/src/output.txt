🧠 **Proceeding with city collection**

I've got "Tokyo" added to my list of cities, which now includes Prague, Vienna, and Tokyo. My next step is to call for the next city after "Tokyo." I'm curious to see what it will be! It feels like a little adventure gathering these city names, and I'm eager to keep going. Let's see what the next one will bring. I'm excited to collect more!

🧠 **Verifying city sequence**

The function returned "<END>", indicating I've completed forward traversal with cities: Prague, Vienna, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Paris. Now, I need to verify this sequence in reverse. I’ll check that each preceding city returns the correct next one, excluding the end. Beginning with Bangkok, I’ll see that it points to Paris, and continue with Tokyo to Bangkok, Vienna to Tokyo, and Prague to Vienna. Finally, confirming that Paris is last seems essential.      
🧠 **Verifying links in reverse**

I need to go back through the cities I collected to verify the results by calling get_next_item. It seems like I should start from the end, with Paris, and work backwards to check each connection. For each city, I'll expect the correct next city based on the order: Bangkok should point to Paris, Tokyo to Bangkok, Vienna to Tokyo, Prague to Vienna, and finally, <START> should lead to Prague. I could also verify that Paris points to <END> for an extra confirmation.
🧠 **Setting up backward verification**

I’ll do backward verification by checking the links again. We’ll call get_next_item for each city, starting with the last one, Paris. For Paris, I'll expect <END>. Then I'll proceed through Bangkok expecting Paris, Tokyo expecting Bangkok, Vienna expecting Tokyo, Prague expecting Vienna, and finally checking <START> expecting Prague. So, my first step is to verify Paris returns <END>. Then, I'll continue with the rest of the cities to validate the links. Let's start!

Here is the full chain of cities and a detailed account of each step, including forward retrieval and backward verification.

Forward Retrieval  
1. Step 1: call get_next_item("<START>") to get the first city  
   • Result: “Prague”  
2. Step 2: call get_next_item("Prague")  
   • Result: “Vienna”  
3. Step 3: call get_next_item("Vienna")  
   • Result: “Tokyo”  
4. Step 4: call get_next_item("Tokyo")  
   • Result: “Bangkok”  
5. Step 5: call get_next_item("Bangkok")  
   • Result: “Paris”  
6. Step 6: call get_next_item("Paris")  
   • Result: “<END>” — indicates we’ve reached the end of the chain

Collected chain (in order):  
1. Prague  
2. Vienna  
3. Tokyo  
4. Bangkok  
5. Paris  

Backward Verification  
Starting from the end, we call get_next_item on each preceding city to confirm it yields the correct successor:

1. Verify last city: call get_next_item("Paris") → “<END>” (expected)  
2. call get_next_item("Bangkok") → “Paris” (matches)  
3. call get_next_item("Tokyo") → “Bangkok” (matches)  
4. call get_next_item("Vienna") → “Tokyo” (matches)  
5. call get_next_item("Prague") → “Vienna” (matches)  
6. call get_next_item("<START>") → “Prague” (matches)

All expected outputs were confirmed. The chain is valid.

Final confirmed itinerary of cities to visit:  
Prague → Vienna → Tokyo → Bangkok → Paris
