# Implementation Log

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Project Initialization

### 2025-06-27

**Completed:**
- ✅ **1.1 Development Environment Setup** - Basic environment setup completed
  - Python 3.11+ installed
  - `uv` package manager installed and verified
  - Project directory created
  - Git repository initialized
  - `.gitignore` file created with comprehensive Python/Reflex/Azure patterns

- ✅ **1.2 Azure OpenAI Setup** - API integration verified
  - Azure OpenAI resource configured
  - GPT-4.1-nano model deployed
  - Azure Default Credentials (AAD) authentication working
  - API test script created and verified successful connection
  - Logprobs functionality confirmed working (99.68% probability for "The", with 5 alternatives)
  - Dependencies installed: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `azure-identity`

- ✅ **1.3 Project Structure Creation** - Complete project structure established
  - Created Reflex-compliant directory structure
  - Main package: `token_visualizer/` with all required subdirectories
  - Subdirectories: `pages/`, `components/`, `state/`, `services/`, `utils/`
  - Additional directories: `assets/`, `tests/`
  - All `__init__.py` files created with proper documentation
  - `pyproject.toml` created by `uv init` with project metadata and dependencies
  - Project dependencies properly configured: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `azure-identity`

**Phase 1 Complete!** ✅
All environment setup and project initialization steps are finished. The project has:
- ✅ Development environment ready
- ✅ Azure OpenAI API integration tested and working
- ✅ Complete project structure following Reflex conventions
- ✅ All dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ AAD authentication verified

**Next Steps:**
Ready to begin Phase 2: Basic Reflex Application
- Add Reflex to dependencies
- Create basic rxconfig.py configuration  
- Build minimal "Hello World" Reflex app

**Notes:**
- `.gitignore` includes specific patterns for Reflex (.web/, .reflex/, reflex.db), UV (.uv/, uv.lock), and Azure deployments
- Ready to proceed with Azure OpenAI API testing (step 1.2)
