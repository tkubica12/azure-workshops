# Implementation Log

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Project Initialization

### 2025-06-27

**Completed:**
- ✅ **1.1 Development Environment Setup** - Basic environment setup completed
  - Python 3.11+ installed
  - `uv` package manager installed and verified
  - Project directory created
  - Git repository initialized
  - `.gitignore` file created with comprehensive Python/Reflex/Azure patterns

- ✅ **1.2 Azure OpenAI Setup** - API integration verified
  - Azure OpenAI resource configured
  - GPT-4.1-nano model deployed
  - Azure Default Credentials (AAD) authentication working
  - API test script created and verified successful connection
  - Logprobs functionality confirmed working (99.68% probability for "The", with 5 alternatives)
  - Dependencies installed: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `azure-identity`

- ✅ **1.3 Project Structure Creation** - Complete project structure established
  - Created Reflex-compliant directory structure
  - Main package: `token_visualizer/` with all required subdirectories
  - Subdirectories: `pages/`, `components/`, `state/`, `services/`, `utils/`
  - Additional directories: `assets/`, `tests/`
  - All `__init__.py` files created with proper documentation
  - `pyproject.toml` created by `uv init` with project metadata and dependencies
  - Project dependencies properly configured: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `azure-identity`

**Phase 1 Complete!** ✅
All environment setup and project initialization steps are finished. The project has:
- ✅ Development environment ready
- ✅ Azure OpenAI API integration tested and working
- ✅ Complete project structure following Reflex conventions
- ✅ All dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ AAD authentication verified

**Phase 2.1 Complete!** ✅
Minimal Reflex application successfully created and running:
- ✅ Reflex dependency added and configured
- ✅ `rxconfig.py` configured with correct app structure (`app_name="token_visualizer"`)
- ✅ Proper directory structure: `token_visualizer/token_visualizer.py`
- ✅ "Hello World" page created with proper Reflex component props
- ✅ App runs successfully at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend runs at http://0.0.0.0:8000
- ✅ UI displays correctly in browser with rocket emoji and styling

**Phase 2.2 Complete!** ✅ **2025-06-29**
Modern UI structure and design system successfully implemented:
- ✅ **Main Layout Component**: Three-column responsive layout (sidebar, content, info panel)
- ✅ **Header Component**: Clean header with brain icon, title, and subtitle
- ✅ **Navigation System**: Sidebar navigation with mode buttons and utility functions
- ✅ **Modern Design System**: ChatGPT-inspired minimalist aesthetic implemented
- ✅ **Color Scheme**: Light mode with white backgrounds, charcoal text, blue accents
- ✅ **Typography**: Inter font family with proper hierarchy and spacing
- ✅ **Lucide Icons**: Professional monochromatic line icons replaced emoji icons
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Desktop three-column, tablet/mobile adaptive layouts
- ✅ **Radix-based Components**: Updated to use modern Reflex with proper prop validation
- ✅ **Welcome Content**: Educational getting-started section with step-by-step guide
- ✅ **Mobile Testing**: Verified responsive behavior on mobile devices

**Technical Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed Reflex module import structure (needed `app_name/app_name.py` pattern)
- Corrected component prop types (heading size, vstack spacing, margin values)
- Disabled Tailwind deprecation warning
- Established proper Python package structure

**Phase 2.2 Technical Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ **Radix Component Props**: Discovered and fixed prop validation for modern Reflex
- ✅ **Button Sizing**: Updated from `"lg"` to `"4"` for large button size
- ✅ **Spacing Values**: Changed from CSS units to numbered strings `"1"` through `"9"`
- ✅ **Grid Properties**: Fixed `columns` and `gap` props to use string literals
- ✅ **Icon System**: Replaced emoji with professional Lucide icons (`zap`, `activity`, `palette`, etc.)
- ✅ **Navigation Alignment**: Fixed icon-text alignment issues in navigation buttons
- ✅ **Color Consistency**: Implemented consistent minimal color scheme throughout
- ✅ **State Management**: Added basic navigation state for future interactive features

**Design System Documentation:**
- ✅ Updated design document with Radix-based Reflex specifications
- ✅ Documented Lucide icon usage and style guidelines
- ✅ Recorded proper prop types and validation patterns for future reference

**Next Steps:**
Ready to begin Phase 2.3: Environment Configuration
- Create `.env` file for environment variables
- Add Azure OpenAI configuration variables
- Implement configuration loading in application

**Notes:**
- `.gitignore` includes specific patterns for Reflex (.web/, .reflex/, reflex.db), UV (.uv/, uv.lock), and Azure deployments
- Ready to proceed with Azure OpenAI API testing (step 1.2)
