# Creating rich documents
1. How being very **explicit** in prompt will help you get what you want?
2. **Iterations** over document - from copy paste or "print it all" to using diffs.
3. Adding **context** always helps and why your site should have llms.txt file.
4. Using **tools** to retrieve context automatically.
5. Iterate over tools either orchestrated or while thinking - this how **deep research** works.
