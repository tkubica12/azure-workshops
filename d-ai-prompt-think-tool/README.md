# AI Demo - from prompting to thinking to tool use
In this demo we will touch prompt engineering, reasoning, multi-step orchestration and tool use, but not as separate topics, but as a **story** of how to get better at certain tasks.

## Story of getting better at math
See [full guide](./docs/math.md) for more details.

1. How relatively **simple prompt** can improve the performance of pretty small LLMs in math tasks.
2. How **heavy prompt with guidance**, thinking process and examples can improve performance of very small LLMs in math tasks.
3. What if we orchestrate calling LLM multiple times so it can **reflect** on its own errors and improve the answer?
4. What if we automate process of AI trying various thinking strategies using Reinforcement Learning in verifiable domains and that capture successful ones and use it as training data to self-improve models? This is how **reasoning models** are trained and we will see how much better they are in math tasks.
5. But why let LLM calculate where it can use calculator or write some code? Solving our math challenge with **agent using tools**.
