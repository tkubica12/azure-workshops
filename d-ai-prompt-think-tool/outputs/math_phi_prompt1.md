Step 1: Setup the multiplication problem  
I will multiply 7952 by 9823 using long multiplication.  
   
Step 2: Multiply the units  
Multiply the units place of the second number (3) by each digit of the first number (7952), starting from the units place.  
  
    7952  
  x  9823  
-----------  
   23856  (3 * 7952)  
   
Step 3: Multiply the tens place  
Now, we will multiply the tens place of the second number (2, which represents 20) by each digit of the first number (7952). Remember to shift one position to the left as it represents tens.  
  
    7952  
  x 9823  
-----------  
   23856  (3 * 7952)  
  159040  (20 * 7952, shifted one position left)  
   
Step 4: Multiply the hundreds place  
Next, we will multiply the hundreds place of the second number (8, which represents 800) by each digit of the first number (7952). Shift two positions left since it represents hundreds.  
  
    7952  
  x 9823  
-----------  
   23856  (3 * 7952)  
  159040  (20 * 7952)  
 6361600  (800 * 7952, shifted two positions left)  
   
Step 5: Multiply the thousands place  
Now, we will multiply the thousands place of the second number (9, which represents 9000) by each digit of the first number (7952). Shift three positions left for thousands.  
  
    7952  
  x 9823  
-----------  
   23856  (3 * 7952)  
  159040  (20 * 7952)  
 6361600  (800 * 7952)  
69568000  (9000 * 7952, shifted three positions left)  
   
Step 6: Add the results  
Now, we will add up all the results from the previous steps.  
  
    23856  
  159040  
 6361600  
69568000  
-----------  
79062856  
   
Final Answer: 79062856  
   
So, 7952 * 9823 = 79062856.
