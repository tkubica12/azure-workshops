Let me first load and examine the contents of the uploaded file to understand its structure and identify the relevant columns for analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the uploaded file to examine its structure
file_path = '/mnt/data/assistant-TcTPgYKeZUT4W8uqU4ZsWF'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows and column information to understand the structure
data.head(), data.info()
```

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **Country**: Name of the country.
2. **ISO3 Code**: ISO3 code of the country.
3. **Date**: Date of the electricity price record.
4. **Price (EUR/MWhe)**: Electricity price in EUR per megawatt-hour.

To determine the country with the largest single-day percentage change in electricity price, I will:

1. Calculate the daily percentage change in electricity price for each country.
2. Identify the maximum percentage change and the corresponding country.

Let me proceed with this analysis.

```python
# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime for proper sorting and calculations
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

# Sort the data by Country and Date to ensure proper calculation of daily changes
data = data.sort_values(by=['Country', 'Date'])

# Calculate the percentage change in price for each country
data['Price Change (%)'] = data.groupby('Country')['Price (EUR/MWhe)'].pct_change() * 100

# Find the maximum absolute percentage change and the corresponding country
max_change_row = data.loc[data['Price Change (%)'].abs().idxmax()]

max_change_row
```

The country with the largest single-day percentage change in electricity price is **Finland**, with a massive percentage change of **221,000%** on **November 17, 2024**. This indicates an extraordinary shock in electricity prices on that day.
