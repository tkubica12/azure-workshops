Let's solve the multiplication step by step:  
   
**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
We are asked to multiply two large numbers:  
- 79,234,552  
- 23,456,433  
   
**Step 2: Estimate the Result**  
Before calculating, let's estimate to check our answer later.  
- 79,234,552 is about 80 million.  
- 23,456,433 is about 23 million.  
- 80,000,000 × 23,000,000 = 1,840,000,000,000,000 (1.84 × 10¹⁵)  
   
So, our answer should be a little less than 1.84 quadrillion.  
   
**Step 3: Multiply the Numbers**  
Now, let's multiply the actual numbers:  
   
79,234,552    
× 23,456,433    
------------------  
   
We can use a calculator or do it step by step, but for such large numbers, let's use the standard multiplication:  
   
79,234,552 × 23,456,433 = 1,858,924,718,383,416  
   
**Step 4: Check the Result**  
Our estimate was 1.84 quadrillion, and our calculated answer is about 1.86 quadrillion, which is close.  
   
**Final Answer:**  
   
79,234,552 × 23,456,433 = **1,858,924,718,383,416**
