Based on the table, excluding birds and sea animals, there are no very small terrestrial animals listed that are faster than the big, fast animals previously mentioned (such as cheetah, lion, ostrich, red kangaroo, etc.).   
  
The fastest small terrestrial animal in the table is the Red Fox (10 kg, 72 km/h), but this is not faster than the cheetah (120 km/h), ostrich (70 km/h), or even the lion (80 km/h). All other small terrestrial animals have much lower maximum speeds.
