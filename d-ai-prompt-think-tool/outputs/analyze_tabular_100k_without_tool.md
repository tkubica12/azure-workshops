Let's break down the problem:  
   
**Task:**    
Find the country with the biggest "shock" in electricity price, defined as the largest **percentage difference** in price between two consecutive days, for any country, in the data provided.  
   
---  
   
### **Step-by-step Approach**  
   
1. **For each country**, go through its daily prices in order.  
2. **For each consecutive day**, calculate the percentage change:  
   \[  
   \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{|P_{t} - P_{t-1}|}{P_{t-1}} \times 100\%  
   \]  
3. **Find the maximum percentage change** for each country.  
4. **Find the country with the overall maximum percentage change**.

### **Manual Search for Extreme Shocks**  
   
Given the data is huge, let's look for obvious candidates:  
   
#### **Look for very low or very high prices followed by a normal price**  
   
- **Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovakia**: On **2015-04-12**, price is **0.08** (Austria, Germany, Luxembourg), next day is **24.07** (Austria), **24.07/0.08 = 300x** increase, or **29900%**.  
- **Czechia, Slovakia**: On **2015-09-06**, price is **3.5**, next day is **37.21** (Czechia), **37.21/3.5 = 10.6x**, or **960%**.  
- **Romania**: On **2015-04-03**, price is **5.74**, next day is **18.77**, **18.77/5.74 = 3.27x**, or **227%**.  
   
#### **Let's check the Austria case in detail:**  
   
- **Austria**  
  - 2015-04-11: 19.62  
  - 2015-04-12: 0.08  
  - 2015-04-13: 24.07  
  
  - **From 19.62 to 0.08:**    
    \[  
    \frac{|0.08 - 19.62|}{19.62} \approx 99.6\%  
    \]  
  - **From 0.08 to 24.07:**    
    \[  
    \frac{|24.07 - 0.08|}{0.08} = \frac{23.99}{0.08} = 299.875 = 29987.5\%  
    \]  
  
  This is an **enormous shock**.  
   
#### **Check if any other country has a similar pattern:**  
   
- **Germany, Luxembourg**: Same as Austria, 0.08 to 24.07.  
- **Slovakia**: 15.09 to 23.39 (not as big).  
- **Czechia**: 15.09 to 23.39 (not as big).  
   
#### **Any negative prices?**    
No negative prices in the sample.

### **Conclusion**  
   
**The biggest single-day percentage shock in electricity price is in Austria (AUT), Germany (DEU), and Luxembourg (LUX) on 2015-04-13, following a price of 0.08 EUR/MWh on 2015-04-12, jumping to 24.07 EUR/MWh on 2015-04-13.**  
   
- **Percentage change:**    
  \[  
  \frac{24.07 - 0.08}{0.08} \times 100\% = 29987.5\%  
  \]  
   
**So, the answer is:**  
   
---  
   
## **Austria (AUT), Germany (DEU), and Luxembourg (LUX) experienced the biggest shock, with a price jump from 0.08 to 24.07 EUR/MWh (a 29,987.5% increase) between 2015-04-12 and 2015-04-13.**

**If you want the single country, Austria is the first in the list.**    
**If you want all countries with the same shock, it's Austria, Germany, and Luxembourg.**
