Let's break down the multiplication step by step:  
   
7952 × 9823  
   
We can split 9823 into 9000 + 800 + 20 + 3:  
   
7952 × (9000 + 800 + 20 + 3)  
   
Now, we multiply each part separately:  
   
7952 × 9000  
7952 × 800  
7952 × 20  
7952 × 3  
   
Let's calculate each separately:  
   
7952 × 9000:  
7952 × 9 = 71,568  
Then multiply by 1000: 71,568 × 1000 = 71,568,000  
   
7952 × 800:  
7952 × 8 = 63,616  
Then multiply by 100: 63,616 × 100 = 6,361,600  
   
7952 × 20:  
7952 × 2 = 15,904  
Then multiply by 10: 15,904 × 10 = 159,040  
   
7952 × 3:  
7952 × 3 = 23,856  
   
Now, let's add all these results together:  
   
71,568,000  
+ 6,361,600  
+ 159,040  
+ 23,856  
   
Adding carefully step by step:  
   
First, add the two smallest numbers:  
159,040 + 23,856 = 182,896  
Now add this result to 6,361,600:  
6,361,600 + 182,896 = 6,544,496  
Finally, add this result to 71,568,000:  
71,568,000 + 6,544,496 = 78,112,496  
   
**Final Answer:**  
7952 × 9823 = 78,112,496
