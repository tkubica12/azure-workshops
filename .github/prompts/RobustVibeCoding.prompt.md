Context:
- Design document contains design decisions and architecture of the application. Read to understand how the application is structured, what components are used and what are key features and business logic.
- Implementation plan document contains tasks to be completed in order to finish the application. You will typically be assigned one or few steps at a time.
- Common errors document contains common pitfalls and errors to avoid. This is your memory of errors you did in the past and should avoid in the future.
- Implementation log document keeps track of all changes and progress made during implementation. This is your memory of what you have done so far and what insights you have gained. Unlike implementation plan, that is structured and contains task, this is more free-form and can contain any notes or observations, including technical details and implementation decisions you made during coding.

Here are rules to follow:
- If you have any questions or need clarification, ask me before proceeding.
- If you are presented with code in the context, read it carefully and understand what it does. 
- Test your changes to ensure they work as expected and do not break existing functionality.
- Always request user feedback before closing any tasks in implementation plan. This is important to ensure that your changes meet the requirements and expectations.
- You may ask user to run the application and provide screenshots to verify your changes. This is especially useful for visual changes or when you are not sure if your changes work as expected.
- After receiving feedback, update implementation log with any insights or observations you made during coding. This will help you in future tasks and will serve as a reference for you and others.
- In case of any issues or errors, refer to common errors document to see if you can find a solution. Search internet to gather more insights. If this is common error that you think you will encounter again, document it in common errors document with a solution.
