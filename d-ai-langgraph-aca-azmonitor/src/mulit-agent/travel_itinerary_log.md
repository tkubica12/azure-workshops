### Feasible 4-Hour Plan from Prague Airport (Václav Havel Airport)

#### **Key Considerations:**
1. **Travel Time:** Václav Havel Airport (PRG) is about 30-40 minutes from the city center by car/taxi, depending on traffic.
2. **Available Time in Prague:** After accounting for transportation, you’ll have roughly 2.5-3 hours for sightseeing.
3. **Transportation Options:**
   - **Taxi or Ride-Sharing (Recommended):** Costs ~700-900 CZK one way, fastest and most convenient.
   - **Public Transport:** Bus + Metro (~45-50 minutes one way, costs ~40 CZK). Less ideal for such a short visit.

---

### **Proposed Itinerary:**

#### **Hour 1: Arrival and Transfer to Prague City Center**
- **Time Needed:** ~30-40 minutes
- **Recommended Transport:** Taxi or ride-sharing app (e.g., Bolt or Uber).

- **Highlights:**
  - Prague’s iconic **Astronomical Clock** (Orloj) – marvel at the hourly show.
  - Admire the stunning **Gothic Church of Our Lady Before Týn** and **St. Nicholas Church**.
  - Stroll around the square, enjoy the lively atmosphere, and snap some photos.
- **Optional Quick Snack:** Grab a traditional Czech pastry called **trdelník** from a nearby vendor.

---

#### **Hour 3: Charles Bridge and Vltava River Views**
- **Walk (~10 minutes):** From Old Town Square to **Charles Bridge** (Karlův most).
- **Highlights:**
  - Walk across this historic 14th-century bridge, lined with statues and offering breathtaking views of Prague Castle and the Vltava River.
  - Enjoy street performers and artists along the way.
- **Optional Stop:** If time allows, visit the **Lesser Town Bridge Tower** at the end of the bridge for panoramic views (entry ~150 CZK).

---

#### **Hour 4: Return to Airport**
- **Time Needed:** ~30-40 minutes
- **Departure:** Arrange for a taxi or ride-share to pick you up near Charles Bridge or Old Town Square.

---

### **Important Notes:**
1. **Luggage Storage:** If you have luggage, you can store it at the airport’s baggage storage facility (~120 CZK per piece for 24 hours).
2. **Time Management:** Stick to the schedule to avoid missing your return to the airport.
3. **Currency:** Have some Czech koruna (CZK) on hand for small purchases or tips.

Hello, this is Mrs_Budget here to help you make your 4-hour visit to Prague as affordable as possible while still enjoying the highlights. Let’s review Mr_Practical’s plan and tweak it for budget-conscious travelers.

### **Budget-Friendly Adjustments to the Itinerary**

#### **Transportation:**
1. **Public Transport Instead of Taxi:**
   - Take **Bus 119** from Václav Havel Airport to **Nádraží Veleslavín** (20 minutes), then transfer to Metro Line A (Green Line) to **Staroměstská** station (10 minutes). Cost: ~40 CZK (approx. $2 USD) for a 90-minute ticket.
   - Total travel time: ~30-40 minutes, similar to a taxi but significantly cheaper.
   - Note: Tickets can be purchased at the airport from vending machines or kiosks (accepts cash or card).

2. **Return Trip:** Use the same public transport route back to the airport. Ensure you leave the city center at least 1.5 hours before your flight.

---

#### **Sightseeing:**
The suggested stops (Old Town Square and Charles Bridge) are perfect for a short visit, and they’re free to explore. Here’s how to enjoy them on a budget:

1. **Old Town Square:**
   - The square itself is free to explore, and the **Astronomical Clock** show is also free to watch.
   - Skip entering paid attractions like the towers or museums to save money.
   - Instead, enjoy the vibrant atmosphere and take photos of the historic architecture.

2. **Charles Bridge:**
   - Walking across the bridge is completely free.
   - Avoid spending on souvenirs or street performers unless you really want to support them.

3. **Optional Free Add-On:**
   - If you have time, take a short walk to **Kampa Island** (near Charles Bridge) for lovely riverside views and a quieter atmosphere.

---

#### **Food & Snacks:**
1. **Affordable Snacks:**
   - Instead of buying an overpriced trdelník (usually ~100-150 CZK), look for a bakery or grocery store near Old Town Square for a cheaper pastry or sandwich (~30-50 CZK).
   - Alternatively, grab a **smažený sýr** (fried cheese sandwich) from a street vendor for ~60-80 CZK.

2. **Bring Your Own Water Bottle:**
   - Tap water is safe to drink in Prague, so refill your bottle at the airport or a public fountain to avoid buying bottled water.

---

#### **Luggage Storage:**
1. **Cheaper Option:**
   - If you need to store luggage, consider using public lockers at **Hlavní nádraží** (Main Train Station) instead of the airport storage. Prices start at ~60 CZK for small items.
   - You can reach the train station via Metro Line C (Red Line) if needed.

---

### **Revised Budget Summary:**
- **Transportation:** 80 CZK round trip (public transport)
- **Food/Snacks:** 50-80 CZK (bakery or street food)
- **Sightseeing:** Free
- **Luggage Storage (if needed):** ~60-120 CZK
- **Total Estimated Cost:** ~190-280 CZK (~$8-12 USD)
