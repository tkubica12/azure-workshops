### **Transportation**
1. **Getting to Prague**: 
   - If arriving by air, Václav Havel Airport Prague is the main international airport. From there, you can take the Airport Express bus (AE) to the city center (30-40 minutes) or a taxi/Uber for convenience.
   - If arriving by train, Prague’s Main Train Station (Hlavní nádraží) is centrally located and well-connected to public transport.
   - Public transport in Prague (trams, buses, metro) is efficient, affordable, and safe. A 24-hour transport pass costs around 120 CZK (approx. €5).

2. **Getting Around**:

   - Trams (e.g., the scenic Tram 22) are a great option for longer distances.

For a 2-day stay, I recommend staying in or near the Old Town (Staré Město) or Lesser Town (Malá Strana) for easy access to major attractions:
1. **Mid-range options**:
   - Hotel Residence Green Lobster (Malá Strana): Historic charm close to Prague Castle.
   - Hotel Clement (Old Town): Modern amenities near the city center.
2. **Budget options**:
