My personal list replicated itself 13 times and when I deleted the second to last iteration of this it deleted everything I had ever typed into my lists.  Calendar support only available on ipad and android phone, not in browser window.  You have to trick the system into puting a date on items by setting a reminder and then going back in to deactivate the reminder.  I like that you can move items around however you want and that items left undone today stay in the today category instead of just floating out of the system.  It is odd that something as unfinished as this emerges as king of the hill in this category.

You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh.

8154,"28 Oct 2018: same problem. Repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed. Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.",0,negative

6904,"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",2,positive
