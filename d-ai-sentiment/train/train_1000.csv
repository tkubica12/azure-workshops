"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you! (And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.) Edit: Clearing did solve the problem for now. Too bad I had to give up all the progress I made. But thank you anyway, at least I can use the app again.",1

"Any app made well and affective for the needs of the many should be free of limited access and ability, to help them actually acjhieve the goals they have set, like limit 3-5 habits to track...Go PREMIUM and you go for as many goals as you want, hhhmmmm, anyone catching the psychological aspect of limiting a person by a marketing suggestion?

 Wow! Some person u are!,2
Helps me remember things and keep them organized. It can really work cross devices - hassle free!,2
Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,1

"It's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things. Personally, I've found that you get as much as you put into it. There are communities and challenges you can join with like-minded people to help you achieve similar goals, and their are seasonal events as well. There are no adds, no constant pop ups to buy gems, and all features are equally helpful without the gems.",2

"It's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be. After a substantial amount of thought, I succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget, which is essential to keep me on track. However, the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand, so minus one star for that. Also, a true black widget or user-interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens, so fingers crossed for that too.",2

When I press the plus button, I actually expect a list with all possible tasks. But instead of that I only have the possibility to create a new task. At first I thought that I had to subscribe. I have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible. Now I have deleted all tasks from the start screen. If I click on the plus, there is still no list. It comes again: new task",2

Can`t believe this ****! I`ve spend 30 minutes for for a snickers ice cream... Seems like no one does then anymore!,0
Not giving 5 stars because of the following reasons : 1. It's very annoying when you enter into a habit page and you swipe down to scroll down to see stats . But it switches to another habit page. Please fix this . It's counter intuitive. 2. No method to edit the habits online on PC or Mac . Limits the app to smart phones only. Otherwise it's a good app. Does what it is supposed to do.,1

"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.",0

"I bought the Pro version a few weeks ago...great concept. A few things I would like to change but can't find it in the instructions or in other reviews. Is there a way to remove my alarm clock icon on the clock face--it's irrelevant, didn't ask me to place it there, and takes up precious space? Also and most importantly, I would like the hour hand to reflect the ""real time"" so I can visualize instantly how much time is left until the next scheduled task is due. For myself, having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value. If the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect ""real time"" I'll give it a 5, otherwise the App wont work for me and it stays at a 3. I'm surprised no-one else has mentioned this and I'm wondering if my install developed a slight bug. Update...Jan 20, 2020... I received prompt response from developer...fixed issues. My phone was an older Note3 running Android 5.0 so it was a bit different...works fine now...changed to 5 stars.",2

This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right.

a task. It can be put in the details, but when time is of the essence

A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though,2

"I love this app! I can set times, and my tasks will appear in that order. I can set several reminders. When I click Done, the task goes to the bottom under Completed. The app keeps track of my productivity. I like that I can group my tasks in categories. I especially like that when I click on the date, all of my tasks automatically appear. I don't have to be overwhelmed by how much I have to do. I just take 1 task at a time. There's even a Promo timer embedded to help me stay on track.",2

I'm not sure I'll purchase a second year subscription.",1

 How lovely,2
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators.",2
Very helpful to have reminders and important details at your fingertips. I wish there was a way to have it synch with an app or program on your computer.,2
 good luck!! How exciting,2

"There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.",0

"I tried out several to do apps to replace my sun-setting Wunderlist and liked this one the best. The only feature I'm missing at this point (and it is a big one, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) is a list of all tasks/to dos. One master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed! For now I am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround. P.s. I am loving the tags feature, and the audio when you check a task off. So fulfilling!",2

"This application which I used thoroughly, and this application seriously deserves 5 stars ✨. I have given 4 stars because it don't have multiple user merged account in it. Which helps our 4 members of family to write their to-do in a single place.",2
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,1
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.,1

Anyway, I personally still use the app as the visualisation is still way better than Google's. So for me that still beats the major con.",1

This will meet many people's needs. Best multi-platform apps. Best location reminders. Easy to use. I would like start dates and others have requested them for years but Todoist refuses to add them. Down a star for that. The offer a work-around but it's not convenient.,2
Feeling pretty good this morning! Lets hope it lasts through the day,2
"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th.

 The episode was AMAZING...I cried when I saw the home videos they were soooooo cute,2
I love the app but a possibility to put in task progress (0-100%) would be great! In the updated version when I select the filter 'view all' on my widget the subcategories are gone... And now all tasks are only ordered by priority without regard for category. That is very very confusing!! Please bring the categories back!! Or at least an option to show them again.,1
I really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so I can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features.,1

"Tells me it can't import all my data and to retry. But when I retry, it tells me everything is up to date and there's nothing to import! Of course the one list that's missing is the only one that's important... I'll be trying another app, thanks but no thanks.",0

"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.",0
