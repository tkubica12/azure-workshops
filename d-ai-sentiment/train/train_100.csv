"Helps me stop touching my phone It helps me stop touching my phone. However, there is not much thrill in planting the tree. You cannot select where the tree is going to grow, and eventhough there are number of other trees, it cost so much and earn so little from planting it makes it so boring. It can get quite dissapointing",1

"Very sad story of being Wunderlist ancestor. Missing Drag and Drop Missing UX at all Missing ease of using Creating of new task requires your full attention for several painful seconds. App that was meant to make your life easy is now just some list that force me to write my tasks on paper again after few years of using Wunderlist, because paper has much better UX than this one.",0

"I bought the Pro version a few weeks ago...great concept. A few things I would like to change but can't find it in the instructions or in other reviews. Is there a way to remove my alarm clock icon on the clock face--it's irrelevant, didn't ask me to place it there, and takes up precious space? Also and most importantly, I would like the hour hand to reflect the ""real time"" so I can visualize instantly how much time is left until the next scheduled task is due. For myself, having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value. If the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect ""real time"" I'll give it a 5, otherwise the App wont work for me and it stays at a 3. I'm surprised no-one else has mentioned this and I'm wondering if my install developed a slight bug. Update...Jan 20, 2020... I received prompt response from developer...fixed issues. My phone was an older Note3 running Android 5.0 so it was a bit different...works fine now...changed to 5 stars.",2

wow...you leave facebook alone for the weekend and get 60 new notifications. WHEW!,2
Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,1

"Very good app, but It would be nice if you add lasting tasks, for an example a task that starts at 14:00 and finishes at 15:00 I hope you understood me :P",2
"It was good because: -It had the time in form of a clock -It told you the time before a session -It told you the time each session lasts But since I dont have premium, it doesn't let me choose different colors, which is not too bad. Yet, i would like that option for free.",2
